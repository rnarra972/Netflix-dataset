# Netflix-dataset
Power BI Dashboard project, where I analyzed Netflix Data to uncover key streaming trends.
I worked with a dataset containing Netflix TV shows & movies, leveraging MS Excel & SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis before building an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
Key Steps:
 >Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats using Excel.
 > SQL Queries – Extracted key insights such as top genres, content trends over years, and country-wise distribution.
 > Power BI Dashboard – Created interactive visualizations to analyze Netflix's content library effectively.
 Key Insights from Netflix Data:
 > Growth Over Time: Netflix has been expanding its content library, especially post-2015.
 > Top Content Categories: Drama & Comedy dominate both TV shows and movies.
 > Global Reach: The USA has the highest number of Netflix titles, followed by India and the UK.
 > Rise of Netflix Originals: Increasing investment in original content across different genres.
